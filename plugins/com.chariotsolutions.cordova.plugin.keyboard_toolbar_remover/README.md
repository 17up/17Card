# Keyboard Toolbar Remover Cordova Plugin 

The keyboard in an iOS web view has an InputAccessoryView with Previous, Next and Done buttons. This plugin allows the toolbar to be hidden.

# Installation

Assuming you're running Cordova 2.9+ and using the command line interface

    $ cd /path/to/project
    $ cordova plugin add https://github.com/don/KeyboardToolbarRemover
    
# Usage

The plugin creates a global variable called `toolbar` when it is installed.

To disable the toolbar 

	toolbar.hide()

To re-enable the toolbar

	toolbar.show()
	
## Troubleshooting

If you see a bar above the keyboard with iOS7, try adding `height=device-height` to the viewport meta tag. See [Issue 9](https://github.com/don/KeyboardToolbarRemover/issues/9) for more details.

# Credits

The original code to hide the toolbar is based on the [Josh Garnham](http://twitter.com/jgarnham)'s code in a [blog post](http://ios-blog.co.uk/tutorials/rich-text-editing-a-simple-start-part-1/). (Scroll down to the Bonus Code section.)

[Steve Smith](https://github.com/stevenpsmith)'s iOS 7 fix was influenced by [a stack overflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18837551/remove-keyboard-form-toolbar-on-ios7-leaves-a-blur-behind/19042392#19042392).

[Michael Scholz](https://github.com/MichaelRando) and [Shinichi Hosokawa](https://github.com/shosokawa) provided patches for Cordova 3.0 compatibility.
